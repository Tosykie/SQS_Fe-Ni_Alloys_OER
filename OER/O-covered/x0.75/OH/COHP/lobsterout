setting up local basis functions...
 H (pbeVaspFit2015) 1s 
 O (pbeVaspFit2015) 2s 2p_y 2p_z 2p_x 
Fe (pbeVaspFit2015) 4s 3d_xy 3d_yz 3d_z^2 3d_xz 3d_x^2-y^2

INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 406 and upwards will be ignored.
